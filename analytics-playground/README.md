# Analytics Playground

Small, focused Python mini-projects aligned to my Director of Analytics roadmap.

## Projects
- **Day 09 — Secret Auction** (`day09_secret_auction/`): dictionaries, loops, input, winner calculation.
- **Day 10 — Function-Driven Calculator** (`day10_calculator/`): function map, returns vs prints, chaining operations.
- **Day 11 — Blackjack (stub)** (`day11_blackjack/`): structure only; logic to be implemented by me (no spoilers).

## Run locally
```bash
python day09_secret_auction/main.py
python day10_calculator/calculator.py
# Day 11 is a stub for now
```

## Notes
- Each project has its own README with what/why/how.
- This repo is practice-focused; no large/private data committed.
