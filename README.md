# Analytics Playground

Small, focused Python mini-projects aligned to my Director of Analytics roadmap.

## Projects
- **Secret Auction**: dictionaries, loops, input, winner calculation.
- **Function-Driven Calculator**: function map, returns vs prints, chaining operations.
- **Blackjack**.

## Run locally
```bash
python Secret Auction/main.py
python Calculator/calculator.py

```

## Notes
- Each project has its own README with what/why/how.
- This repo is practice-focused; no large/private data committed.
